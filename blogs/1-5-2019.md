Canonical path vs absolute path vs Relative path

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11488754/whats-the-difference-between-canonicalpath-and-absolutepath

Relative path of a file is the **path** of the file relative to the current directory. So if our current directory is `home/kryptokinght/code/` and our file is `sample.txt`. Then the relative path of `sample.txt` 
* relative to the current directory `code` is `sample.txt`
* relative to `kryptokinght` is `code/sample.txt`
* relative to `home` is `kryptokinght/code/sample.txt`   

If a file is present in `home` and we are in `code`, say `a.txt`, then its relative path is `../../a.txt`

In the above example the **asolute path** of `a.txt` is `home/a.txt`

In **NodeJS**, to resolve relative path to absolute path, we use `path.resolve(<file_path>)`. Resolves the file corresponding to the current working directory.

# THE FEYNAMN LEARNING TECHNIQUE

The important part of learning is to really understand it and not just fool yourself into thinking that you have understood it. Albert Einstein said that “If you cannot explain something in a simple manner, you have not understood the topic. So following the steps mentioned in a youtube video, i will try to explain myself ot to you, whoever is reading, how can one properly learn a topic. There are 4 basic steps involved in learning a topic properly, but before you start with these 4 steps get a piece of paper and a pen and be ready to explain it.
	
**The first step** is to write the heading of the topic on the top of the page. It is the most basic but important step. Most of the times we don’t even know what we are learning. 

**The second step** is to explain the topic in simple English by either writing it down or explaining it to someone else or to yourself. Make sure that the explanation is in simple terms and always use examples to solidfy your understanding of the topic. A good way to understand something complex or involving a lot of parts is to draw block diagarams and connect those blocks. This helps you get an understanding of the flow for the topic. Blocks helps in abstracting away small details. 

**The third step** is to find the problem areas and go back to the source and review those areas. This is the most important step because most of the times we don’t understand a topic in one go. So we go back to the source, watch the video or read the whole article again, still don’t understand anything, repeat the same process and this continues forever unless we feel dejected and leave it misunderstood. What we need to do is in the every iteration process of going back to the source, try to explain the process to yourself, find the problem areas, and try to only understand the problem areas. 

**The fourth step** is poinitng out complex terms, the sophisticated terms, the technical jargon, and simplify them. Best way to do this is by thinking ‘ How can you explain this to a kid? ’

**That’s it. Four simple steps to imporve your learning.** 

A really intersting comment from the youtube video which inspired me to write this article: 

*"As a scientist I can assure you, that the best way to understand something is to try to explain it. Just walk into your colleague's office, start explaining your problem, and often enough, you stop mid-sentence, because you just solved it. To really grasp a new technique, include it in one of your courses, preferably with a student assignment on it, and your students will pester you, until you've understood it fully."*

Everything in this world has a optimised structured way of doing it. Be it playing cricket, cooking a receipe, coding or even learning. In order to master something you must follow the structured, optimised way of doing it. One that has been validated by experts and pioneers of that field.

## How does the modern web landscape look?

Having started pretty recently with web development I was intimated by the amout of stuff that one needs to learn. At first i started building static websites using plain HTML, CSS and Javascript(only for animations). It was all fun and jolly before i was introduced to websites running on smartphones, the small screen thingy. 

And so i entered into mobile web development where I was to introduced to topics like @media-width and sending different sized images based on the viewport size using `<picture>` element and lots of other stuff which i don't remember anymore. I went through a free course called Responsive Web Design on Udacity. It introduced the basic concepts of building a responsive website and had a lot of example projects.

There is Server Side rendering and there is Client Side Rendering. In Server Side Rendering an intial markup for you page is rendered on the server before sending it to the client which is your browser. This helps in reducing the inital load time for your webapps while also allowing your users with a quick render of the intro page of your application.
In Client Side Rendering the client is served with an empty HTML file and a lot of Javascript code. All the rendering happens in the client side which is the browser. This causes the app o have a very large load time.
